Data Types are of 2 types - (fig 2.1)

1. Primitive
2. Non-Primitive

-----------------------------------------
1. Primitive Data Types
Ex.:
It specifies the type of a Var and kind of it's value, It is predefined by java
It always holds a Value, default value is 0.
It is predefined and java's inbuilt data type
These can't be used to call methods
It starts with lowercase or $ sign,
Stored in Stack(for small size)


2. Non-Premitive
Ex: String, Array, Objects
These refers to Objects always, these are not basic Data Types, these are user-defined
It don't hold Value, it can be Null also
We have to Create these data types, it is not pre-built(Except String)
It is used to call Methods()
It starts with Uppercase letter.
Stored in Heap(for big size)

Enumeration is a user-defined value type
------------------------------------

Elaboration all 8 Primitive Data Types


Data Type	Description
byte		Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short		Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int		Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long		Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float		Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double		Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
boolean		Stores true or false values
char		Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values

Primitive Number Data Types
It is divided into 2 Groups
Int & Float

1. Integer - It stores byte, short, int, long
2. Float - float, double.

Way of writing 

float floatnum = 7.77f;
float pi = 3.14_28_57F;
double dbnum = 55.125d;
long longnum = 28438640556L;
long creditCardNo = 1211_5178_9212_4231L;

We can use underscores between digits in a number to improve the
readability of our code, as shown below.
long creditCardNo = 1211_5178_9212_4231L ;
Note that we cannot use underscore at the beginning or at the end
of a number, or prior to suffix L

Scientific No.

float floatnum1 = 39e8f;
double doublenum1 = 96E3d;
_______________________________________

A variable is a container which can hold a constant value.
The container is typically a memory location and the variable is the name given to the location in memory.
int x = 5;
5 is constant value, stored in stack memory location
x is the name given to that location.

Value of Constant can't be changed it is also called literals
Var is called Identifier.

Keywords

These are predefined words, explained to java compiler.

int age = 22;

here, age is a variable, it is not defined in keywords, but int is a keyword it is predefined.
we can't use keywords like -

int int = 2;

it is wrong.

There are 48 Keywords in Java.(Fig. 2.4)
